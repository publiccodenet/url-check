# TODO

* tests

* make a web page (jekyll?) to display the results

* build a git workflow that pushes the results to gh-pages branch

* make the repo name-urls dictionary a configuration file

* look to see if there is a more git-diff friendly format, json5 ?
  * https://pypi.org/project/json5/
  * Objects and arrays may end with trailing commas

* allow the file to purge older entries, perhaps
  * keep only the last N checks, or
  * thin the history in some smarter way
